# Lj-Create
In this project, I have registered multilingual sidebars/widgets (US, UK, ES) in the mobile menu, integrated WooCommerce GTIN fields, added geolocation-based language redirection, and improved cookie consent. I also developed a custom WPML URL conversion strategy for language-based subdirectories and API management.
